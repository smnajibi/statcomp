  ## Agenda
  
  
- Basics of optimization
- Gradient descent
- Newton's method
- Curve-fitting
- R: `optim`, `nls`



## Examples of Optimization Problems


- Minimize mean-squared error of regression surface 
- Maximize likelihood of distribution 
- Maximize output of tanks from given supplies and factories;
- Maximize return of portfolio for given volatility 
- Minimize cost of airline flight schedule 



## Optimization Problems


Given an **objective function** $f: \mathcal{D} \mapsto R$, find

\[
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{argmax}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmin}{argmin}
\theta^* = \argmin_{\theta}{f(\theta)}
\]

Basics: maximizing $f$ is minimizing $-f$:

\[
\argmax_{\theta}{f(\theta)}= \argmin_{\theta}{-f(\theta)}
\]

If $h$ is strictly increasing (e.g., $\log$), then

\[
\argmin_{\theta}{f(\theta)} = \argmin_{\theta}{h(f(\theta))}
\]



## Considerations


- Approximation: How close can we get to $\theta^*$, and/or $f(\theta^*)$?

- Time complexity: How many computer steps does that take?  
<small>Varies with precision of approximation, niceness of $f$, size of
$\mathcal{D}$, size of data, method...</small>

- Most optimization algorithms use **successive approximation**, so
distinguish number of iterations from cost of each iteration



## You remember calculus, right?


Suppose $x$ is one dimensional and $f$ is smooth. If $x^*$ is an **interior** minimum / maximum / extremum point

\[
{\left. \frac{df}{dx} \right|}_{x=x^*} = 0
\]

If $x^*$ a minimum,
\[
{\left. \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}\right|}_{x=x^*} > 0
\]



----

This all carries over to multiple dimensions:

At an **interior extremum**,
\[
\nabla f(\theta^*) = 0
\]

At an **interior minimum**,
\[
\nabla^2 f(\theta^*) \geq 0
\]
meaning for any vector $v$,
\[
v^T \nabla^2 f(\theta^*) v \geq 0
\]
$\nabla^2 f =$ the **Hessian**, $\mathbf{H}$


$\theta$ might just be a **local** minimum



## Gradients and Changes to f

\[
f^{\prime}(x_0)  =  {\left. \frac{df}{dx}\right|}_{x=x_0} = \lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}{\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}} \]

\[    f(x)  \approx f(x_0) +(x-x_0)f^{\prime}(x_0)
\]

Locally, the function looks linear; to minimize a linear function, move down the slope

Multivariate version:
\[
f(\theta) \approx f(\theta_0) + (\theta-\theta_0) \cdot \nabla f(\theta_0)
\]

$\nabla f(\theta_0)$ points in the direction of fastest ascent at $\theta_0$



## Gradient Descent


1. Start with initial guess for $\theta$, step-size $\eta$
2. While ((not too tired) and (making adequate progress))
- Find gradient $\nabla f(\theta)$
- Set $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \nabla f(\theta)$
3. Return final $\theta$ as approximate $\theta^*$

Variations: adaptively adjust $\eta$ to make sure of improvement or search along the gradient direction for minimum

<!--

## Pros and Cons of Gradient Descent


Pro:

- Moves in direction of greatest immediate improvement
- If $\eta$ is small enough, gets to a local minimum eventually, and then stops

Cons:

- "small enough" $\eta$ can be really, really small
- Slowness or zig-zagging if components of $\nabla f$ are very different sizes

How much work do we need?


## Scaling


Big-$O$ notation:

\[
h(x) = O(g(x))
\]

means

\[
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}{\frac{h(x)}{g(x)}} = c
\]

for some $c \neq 0$  

<small>e.g., $x^2 - 5000x + 123456778 = O(x^2)$</small>

<small>e.g., $e^{x}/(1+e^{x}) = O(1)$</small>

Useful to look at over-all scaling, hiding details

Also done when the limit is $x\rightarrow 0$



## How Much Work is Gradient Descent?



Pro:

- For nice $f$, $f(\theta) \leq f(\theta^*)+\epsilon$ in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations
+ <small>For _very_ nice $f$, only $O(\log{\epsilon^{-1}})$
iterations</small>
- To get $\nabla f(\theta)$, take $p$ derivatives, $\therefore$ each iteration costs $O(p)$

Con:

- Taking derivatives can slow down as data grows --- each iteration might really be $O(np)$

-->

## Taylor Series


What if we do a quadratic approximation to $f$?

\[
f(x) \approx f(x_0) + (x-x_0)f^{\prime}(x_0) + \frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^2
f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)
\]


<small>Special cases of general idea of Taylor approximation</small>

Simplifies if $x_0$ is a minimum since then $f^{\prime}(x_0) = 0$:

\[
f(x) \approx f(x_0) + \frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^2 f^{\prime\prime}(x_0)
\]

Near a minimum, smooth functions look like parabolas


Carries over to the multivariate case:
\[
f(\theta) \approx f(\theta_0) + (\theta-\theta_0) \cdot \nabla f(\theta_0) +
\frac{1}{2}(\theta-\theta_0)^T \mathbf{H}(\theta_0) (\theta-\theta_0)
\]


## Minimizing a Quadratic


If we know
\[
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\]

we minimize exactly:

\[
\begin{eqnarray*}
2ax^* + b & = & 0\\
x^* & = & \frac{-b}{2a}
\end{eqnarray*}
\]

If
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}a (x-x_0)^2 + b(x-x_0) + c
\]

then
\[
x^* = x_0 - a^{-1}b
\]




## Newton's Method




Taylor-expand for the value *at the minimum* $\theta^*$
  \[
    f(\theta^*) \approx f(\theta) + (\theta^*-\theta) \nabla f(\theta) +
      \frac{1}{2}(\theta^*-\theta)^T \mathbf{H}(\theta) (\theta^*-\theta)
    \]

Take gradient, set to zero, solve for $\theta^*$:
  \[
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    0 & = & \nabla f(\theta) + \mathbf{H}(\theta) (\theta^*-\theta) \\
    \theta^* & = & \theta - {\left(\mathbf{H}(\theta)\right)}^{-1} \nabla f(\theta)
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \]

Works *exactly* if $f$ is quadratic  
<small>and $\mathbf{H}^{-1}$ exists, etc.</small>
  
  If $f$ isn't quadratic, keep pretending it is until we get close to
$\theta^*$, when it will be nearly true



## Newton's Method: The Algorithm


1. Start with guess for $\theta$
  2. While ((not too tired) and (making adequate progress))
- Find gradient $\nabla f(\theta)$ and Hessian $\mathbf{H}(\theta)$
  - Set $\theta \leftarrow \theta - \mathbf{H}(\theta)^{-1} \nabla f(\theta)$
  
  3. Return final $\theta$ as approximation to $\theta^*$
  
  Like gradient descent, but with inverse Hessian giving the step-size

<small>"This is about how far you can go with that gradient"</small>
  
  <!--
  
  ## Advantages and Disadvantages of Newton's Method
  
  Pros:
  
  - Step-sizes chosen adaptively through 2nd derivatives, much harder to get zig-zagging, over-shooting, etc.
- Also guaranteed to need $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to get within $\epsilon$ of optimum
- Only $O(\log\log{\epsilon^{-1}})$ for very nice functions
- Typically many fewer iterations than gradient descent



## Advantages and Disadvantages of Newton's Method


Cons:
  
  - Hopeless if $\mathbf{H}$ doesn't exist or isn't invertible
- Need to take $O(p^2)$ second derivatives *plus* $p$ first derivatives
- Need to solve $\mathbf{H} \theta_{\mathrm{new}} = \mathbf{H} \theta_{\mathrm{old}} - \nabla f(\theta_{\mathrm{old}})$ for $\theta_{\mathrm{new}}$
  + <small>inverting $\mathbf{H}$ is $O(p^3)$, but cleverness gives
$O(p^2)$ for solving for $\theta_{\mathrm{new}}$</small>
  
  
  ## Getting Around the Hessian
  
  
  Want to use the Hessian to improve convergence

Don't want to have to keep computing the Hessian at each step

Approaches:

- Use knowledge of the system to get some approximation to the Hessian, use that instead of taking derivatives ("Fisher scoring")
- Use only diagonal entries ($p$ unmixed 2nd derivatives)
- Use $\mathbf{H}(\theta)$ at initial guess, hope $\mathbf{H}$ changes
*very* slowly with $\theta$
- Re-compute $\mathbf{H}(\theta)$ every $k$ steps, $k > 1$
- Fast, approximate updates to the Hessian at each step (BFGS)


## Other Methods


- Lots!
- See bonus slides at end for for "Nedler-Mead", a.k.a. "the simplex method", which doesn't need any derivatives
- See bonus slides for the meta-method "coordinate descent"

  ## Curve-Fitting by Optimizing
  
  
  We have data $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots (x_n, y_n)$
  
  We also have possible curves, $r(x;\theta)$
  
  e.g., $r(x) = x \cdot \theta$
  
  e.g., $r(x) = \theta_1 x^{\theta_2}$
  
  <!--
  e.g., $r(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{q}{\theta_j b_j(x)}$ for fixed "basis" functions
$b_j$
  -->
  
  
  
  ## Curve-Fitting by Optimizing
  
  
  Least-squares curve fitting:
  
  \[
    \hat{\theta} = \argmin_{\theta}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - r(x_i;\theta))^2}}
    \]


"Robust" curve fitting: 
  \[
    \hat{\theta} = \argmin_{\theta}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\psi(y_i - r(x_i;\theta))}}
    \]

## Derivatives in R

```{r}
f <- expression(5*x^2+3*x+1) ; deriv(f,"x")
x <- 2:4 ; eval(deriv(f,"x"))
```

## Integrate in R

```{r}
g <- function(x) eval(f)
integrate(g,lower = 0,upper = 2)
h <- function(x) exp(cos(x)^2)+exp(sin(x))
integrate(h,1,5)
```

## Optimization in R: optim()


```
optim(par, fn, gr, method, control, hessian)
```

- `fn`: function to be minimized; mandatory
- `par`: initial parameter guess; mandatory
- `gr`: gradient function; only needed for some methods
- `method`: defaults to a gradient-free method (``Nedler-Mead''), could be BFGS (Newton-ish)
- `control`: optional list of control settings
+ <small>(maximum iterations, scaling, tolerance for convergence, etc.)</small>
  - `hessian`: should the final Hessian be returned? default FALSE

Return contains the location (`$par`) and the value (`$val`) of the optimum, diagnostics, possibly `$hessian`


## Optimization in R: optim()


```{r}
gmp <- read.table("../data/gmp.dat")
gmp$pop <- gmp$gmp/gmp$pcgmp
library(numDeriv)
mse <- function(theta) { mean((gmp$pcgmp - theta[1]*gmp$pop^theta[2])^2) }
grad.mse <- function(theta) { grad(func=mse,x=theta) }
theta0=c(5000,0.15)
fit1 <- optim(theta0,mse,grad.mse,method="BFGS",hessian=TRUE)
```


## fit1: Newton-ish BFGS method


```{r}
fit1[1:3]
```


## fit1: Newton-ish BFGS method


```{r}
fit1[4:6]
```



## nls


`optim` is a general-purpose optimizer

So is `nlm` --- try them both if one doesn't work

`nls` is for nonlinear least squares



## nls


```
nls(formula, data, start, control, [[many other options]])
```

- `formula`: Mathematical expression with response variable, predictor variable(s), and unknown parameter(s)
- `data`: Data frame with variable names matching `formula`
- `start`: Guess at parameters (optional)
- `control`: Like with `optim` (optional)

Returns an `nls` object, with fitted values, prediction methods, etc.

The default optimization is a version of Newton's method



## fit2: Fitting the Same Model with nls()


```{r}
fit2 <- nls(pcgmp~y0*pop^a,data=gmp,start=list(y0=5000,a=0.1))
summary(fit2)
```


## fit2: Fitting the Same Model with nls()


```{r}
plot(pcgmp~pop,data=gmp)
pop.order <- order(gmp$pop)
lines(gmp$pop[pop.order],fitted(fit2)[pop.order])
curve(fit1$par[1]*x^fit1$par[2],add=TRUE,lty="dashed",col="blue")
```

## Maximize log-likelihood

Imagine that we have a sample that was drawn from a normal distribution with unknown mean, $\mu$, and variance, $\sigma^2$. The objective is to estimate these parameters. The normal log-likelihood function is given by 

$$ l = −.5 n ln (2\pi)−.5 n ln(\sigma^2)− \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i} (y_i -\mu)^2 $$
  We can program this function in the following way:
  
```{r}
normal.lik<-function(theta,y) { 
  mu<-theta[1]
  sigma2<-theta[2]
  n <- length(y)
  logl <- -.5*n*log(2*pi) -.5*n*log(sigma2) - (1/(2*sigma2))*sum((y-mu)**2) 
  return (-logl)
}
```

----
  
  Once the log-likelihood function has been declared, then the optim command can be invoked. The minimal specification of this command is

`optim(starting values, log-likelihood, data)`

Given a vector of data, y, the parameters of the normal distrib- ution can be estimated using
```{r,warning=FALSE}
y <- rnorm(1000,1,5);
optim(c(0,1),normal.lik,y=y,method="BFGS")
```
## Summary


1. Trade-offs: complexity of iteration vs. number of iterations vs. precision of approximation
+ Gradient descent: less complex iterations, more guarantees, less adaptive
+ Newton: more complex iterations, but few of them for good functions, more adaptive, less robust
2. Start with pre-built code like `optim` or `nls`, implement your own as needed
